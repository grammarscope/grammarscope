Dependency parsing : GrammarScope brings UDPipe's parser to the mobile.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grammarscope.udpipe

The free app infers dependency parses of natural language sentences and offers visualisation (both graph and text).

This flavour of GrammarScope uses UDPipe's framework as its parsing engine/service. Likewise, there's a sister version of GrammarScope that uses Google's SyntaxNet+Tensorflow ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grammarscope ). Both share user interface code. NB: There's a GrammarScope version for the desktop that leverages Stanford CoreNlp power, but there's little in common besides the philosophy).

It works on middle to high-end Android phones, exclusively relying on onboard computing power (no internet connection) and is brisk enough (see screencast). For the record, I tested on a Galaxy S7 that doesn't have neural chips.

It's not intended to batch-process whole texts and has the limitation of working at sentence level, though OpenNLP's Sentence Boundary Detection has been added for English and French. But it does a good job of instant sentence testing.

Currently it supports English and French as builtin languages but extra ready-to-use trained models can be downloaded to be used within the app : 

Chinese-gsd
Czech-cac
Czech-pdt
English-ewt
English-gum
English-lines
English-partut
French-gsd
French-partut
French-sequoia
French-spoken
German-gsd
Hindi-hdtb
Italian-isdt
Japanese-gsd
Russian-gsd
Russian-syntagrus
Russian-taiga
Spanish-ancora
Spanish-gsd
Urdu-udtb

The set can be easily extended to encompass the 70 languages available universaldependencies.org or . You'll find the bash script that packages a UDPipe model into a format that GrammarScope understands (basically: rename to model.udpipe, add md5, add language info) so you can download your own models.

Lastly, I don't work for a business, the app is free for the linguist to use. Enjoy!
