To the people at Ufal,

You are getting this email because you were listed on the People's page on Ufal's web and not knowing who this announcement would be of interest for I took the easiest way of reaching all. Sorry if I bothered you.

This is an announcement about UDPipe being ported to the mobile. It will be posted within a few days to corpora + elsenet lists. I thought a preview to the Ufal team would be in order before doing so, so that they can submit any useful remark.

Here it goes:

"""

Dependency parsing : GrammarScope brings UDPipe's parser to the mobile.
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grammarscope.udpipe

The free app infers dependency parses of natural language sentences and offers visualisation (both graph and text).

This flavour of GrammarScope uses UDPipe's framework as its parsing engine/service. Likewise, there's a sister version of GrammarScope that uses Google's SyntaxNet+Tensorflow ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grammarscope ). Both share user interface code. NB: There's a GrammarScope version for the desktop that leverages Stanford CoreNlp power, but there's little in common besides the philosophy).

It works on middle to high-end Android phones, exclusively relying on onboard computing power (no internet connection) and is brisk enough (see real-time screencast on the emulator). For the record, I tested on a Galaxy S7 that doesn't have neural chips.

It's not intended to batch-process whole texts and has the limitation of working at sentence level, though OpenNLP's Sentence Boundary Detection has been added for English and French. But it does a good job of instant sentence testing.

Currently it supports English and French as builtin languages but extra ready-to-use trained models can be downloaded to be loaded by the app : 

Chinese-gsd
Czech-cac
Czech-pdt
English-ewt
English-gum
English-lines
English-partut
French-gsd
French-partut
French-sequoia
French-spoken
German-gsd
Hindi-hdtb
Italian-isdt
Japanese-gsd
Russian-gsd
Russian-syntagrus
Russian-taiga
Spanish-ancora
Spanish-gsd
Urdu-udtb

The set can be easily extended to encompass the 70 languages available universaldependencies.org. You'll find the bash script that packages a UDPipe model into a format that GrammarScope understands (basically: rename to model.udpipe, add md5, add language info and samples) so you can download your own models.

You can get the app from:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.grammarscope.udpipe
(supported archs are armabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64)

Lastly, I don't work for a business, the app is free for the linguist to use. Enjoy!

"""

Important note:

With each model package comes a set of sentences to test the parser on as a first hands-on experience. Not speaking any language besides French, English and a bit of Spanish, I was not able to include anything other than a Google translation of a set phrase. I'd be grateful if some of you would contribute a handful of sample sentences, notably in Czech.
